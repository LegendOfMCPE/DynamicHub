<h2>
<a id="what-does-dynamichub-do" class="anchor" href="#what-does-dynamichub-do" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does DynamicHub do?</h2>

<p>DynamicHub is a <a href="https://github.com/PocketMine" class="user-mention">@PocketMine</a> plugin. It provides a framework where continuous-game plugins (e.g. Kit PvP, Parkour) and match-based-game plugins (e.g. Spleef, SkyWars) can be easily built upon. DynamicHub provides the option to make a single-game server, a hub-based server (where you have multiple games connected with a hub world) or a network server (where player data are connected together).</p>

<p>DynamicHub offers the option to choose between file-based data saving and MySQL-based data saving. If you use MySQL-based data saving, you can share the data with other servers so that player data, e.g. inventories, are the same on all servers that have the same game type (a.k.a. module, which may refer to hub or a game) (they will get the same inventory loaded in any servers anytime as long as they are in the same module).</p>

<p>DynamicHub provides compatibility with <em>SimpleAuth</em> by the <a href="https://github.com/PocketMine" class="user-mention">@PocketMine</a> Team and <em>ServerAuth</em> by <a href="https://github.com/EvolSoft" class="user-mention">@EvolSoft</a>, or you can choose not to use any auth plugins (although that is strongly discouraged). That is because to ensure account safety, player data would <em>not</em> be loaded until the player has been authenticated. Integration can also be easily created for other auth plugins.</p>

<h2>
<a id="an-extensive-api" class="anchor" href="#an-extensive-api" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>An extensive API</h2>

<p>DynamicHub has an extensive API that allows games to be easily created. A developer can easily create a game plugin only thinking about what is happening inside the game, and DynamicHub will handle the rest of plugin compatibility.</p>

<h3>
<a id="matches-api" class="anchor" href="#matches-api" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Matches API</h3>

<p>DynamicHub also provides a "Matches API" for match-based games, such as Sky Wars, Hunger Games, etc. The Matches API provides a lot of features, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>automatic queuing for matches</li>
<li>automatically loading fresh new maps from zip files, online zip files or local directories</li>
<li>systematic logging of match events (will be useful for reviewing the game on websites)</li>
</ul>
